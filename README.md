This page provides an overview of the flickr-related resources used for  
the JSALT Rosetta workshop, links to the original images, text, and speech  
databases, as well as additional resources not collected/used within the
JSALT Rosetta workshop but that might be relevant for researchers working  
with the flickr database.

When using the flickr database, please ensure you have the  
license/permission to do so. For more information, see the corresponding  
database websites.

sometimes forced-alignments failed due to discrepancies between the audio  
and the transcriptions
